# Python Indentation
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

#Example:
if 5>2:
    print(5,"is greater than",2); # NOTE: in print() function, we output multiple variables or values by separating with a comma
   
    
# Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

# Syntax Error:    
# if 5 > 2:
# print("Five is greater than two!")



# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")
