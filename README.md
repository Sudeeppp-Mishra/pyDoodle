# 🌀 pyDoodle

Welcome to `pyDoodle` — a messy, magical space where I explore Python, one file at a time.

This repo is not about perfection.  
It's about practice, curiosity, and figuring things out as I go.  
From core Python to NumPy, pandas, and whatever else catches my interest.

### 🧪 What's Inside?
- 🔸 Random experiments
- 🔸 Practice scripts
- 🔸 Concept reviews
- 🔸 Notes-to-self in code

### 📅 Currently Exploring
- Core Python basics
- NumPy and pandas

More structure may (or may not 😄) come later.

Feel free to peek around!
