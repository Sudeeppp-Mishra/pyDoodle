    "## What is a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual envrionment** is an isolated environment on your computer, where you can run and test your Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without interfering with other projects or the original Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a virtual environment as a separate container for each Python project. Each container:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has its own Python interpreter\n",
    "- Has its own set of installed packages\n",
    "- Is isolated from other virtual environments\n",
    "- Can have different versions of the same package\n",
    "\n",
    "Using virtual environments is important because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It prevents package version conflickts between projects\n",
    "- Makes projects more portable and reproducible\n",
    "- Keeps your system Python installation clean \n",
    "- Allows testing with different Python versions\n",

    "## Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has the built-in `venv` module for creating virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtal environmnet on your computer, oopen the command prompt, and navigate to the folder where you wnat to create your project, then type this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m venv myfirstproject` (For macOS/Linux/Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will set up a virtual environment, and create a folder named \"myfirstproject\" with subfolders and files, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myfirstproject/\n",
    "|- Include/\n",
    "|- Lib/\n",
    "|- Scripts/\n",
    "    |-.gitignore\n",
    "    |-pyvenv.cfg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activate Virtual Enviornment\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the virtual environment, you have to activate it with this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`myfirstproject\\Scripts\\activate` (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "`source myfirstproject/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "After activation, your prompt will change to show taht you are now working in the active environmnet:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The command lin ewill look like this when teh virtual environment is active:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(myfirstproject) C:\\Users\\Your Name>` (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "`(myfirstproject) ... $` (macOS/Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your virtual environmnet is activatd, you can install packages in it, using `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will install a package called 'cowsay':\n",
    "\n",
    "Install 'cowsay' in the virtual environmnet:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install cowsay` (Windows/macOS/Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "but mostly in macOS/Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip3 install cowsay` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "\n",
    "'cowsay' is installed only in the virtual environmnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the 'cowsay' module is installed in your virtual environment, lets use it to display a talking cow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file called `test.py` on your computer. You can place it wherever you want, but I will place it in teh same location as the `myfirstproject` folder -not in teh folder, but in the same location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the file and insert these three lines in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cowsay\n",
    "\n",
    "cowsay.cow(\"Good Moooooorning!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, try to execute the file while your are in the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python test.py` or if it don't works then `python3 test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the 'cowsay' module is to draw a cow that says whatever input you give it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  ________________\n",
    "| Good Moooorning! |\n",
    "  ================\n",
    "                \\\n",
    "                 \\\n",

    "                   (__)\\       )\\/\\\n",
    "                       ||----w |\n",

    "## Deactivate Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate teh virtual environment use this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`deactivate` in command line/terminal/command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal command line interface will show up.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to execute the `test.py` file outside of the virtual environment, you will get an error because 'cowsay' is missing. It was only installed in the virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: The virtual environment myfirstproject still exists, it is just not activated. If you activate the virtual environment again, you can execute the test.py file, and the diagram will be displayed.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Delete Virtual Environmnet\n",
    "\n",
    "Another nice thing about working with a virtual environmnet is that when you, for some reason want to delete it, there are no otehr projects depend on it, and only the modules and files in the specified virtual environmnet are deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a virtual envrionment, you can simply delete its folder with all its content. Either directly in teh file system, or use the command line interface like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ rm-rf myfirstproject` (macOS/Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "`C:\\Users\\Your *Name*> rmdir /s /q myfirstproject` (Windows)\n",
