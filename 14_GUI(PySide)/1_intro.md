# PySide6 Widgets: Built Cross Platform Desktop apps with Qt

## Python + Qt = Robust GUIs for Windows, Linux and Mac

### What is Qt then??
- **Qt** is a **C++ framework** for making GUIs 
- It's what **big professional apps use** to build windows, buttons, sliders, charts, etc.
- But, it is written in **C++**

1. Cross platform
2. Windows, Linux, Mac
3. Anroid, iOS
4. Embedded
5. A single code base, you just recompile for the target of interest

so here comes **PySlide**:

# PySide

- Python bindings for Qt meaning that **PySide lets you use Qt with Python** instead of C++
- We write Python code, but under the hood, Qt is doing the GUI work
- PySide6 is the latest version (works with Qt6)

So think of it like if **Qt** is entine, **PySide is the Python steering wheel**. We control the GUI in Python

and there is **PyQt** as well:

## PyQt

- Another Python binding for Qt.
- Very similar to PySide, just a different project and license.
- Almost all PyQt tutorials work for PySide too.

# PySide6 (Qt For Python)

1. Corss platform
2. Windows, Linux, Mac
3. A single code base, you just recompile for the target of interest

# What about PyQt

1. Can also be used to build cross platform desktop apps
2. The API is mostly similar to PySide6
3. BUT: requires a separate license for commercial applications
4. This course won't cover PyQt but you can quickly pick it up with the knowledge from this course

# APIs

1. Qt Widgets (GUIs for Desktop Platform) -> we will learn it
2. QML (GUIs for mobile and embedded devices and can also run on desktop)

# Qt is more than just GUIs

- Network
- Threading
- Databases
- Tons of other utility classes
